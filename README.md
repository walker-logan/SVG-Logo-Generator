## Project Description

This application allows freelance web developers to generate basic logos, streamlining the design process. Users are prompted for logo specifications, and an SVG file is created based on their input. The project demonstrates back-end development potential without a UI, showcases a first implementation of unit testing, and reflects a growing developer mindset by incorporating basic error handling.

## Installation

Copy the SSH key of this github repository and clone it to your local device. Install Node.js v16 (consult documentation for the correct command). After installation, initialize and create a package.json with npm init -y. Install dependencies using npm i (you may need to install inquirer v8.2.4 and the latest jest version with npm i inquirer@8.2.4 and npm i jest, respectively). Run the application by typing node index.js in the terminal.

## Usage

To execute this application, navigate to the application directory via the command line, install all required dependencies with npm i, and enter the command node index.js. You will be guided through several questions, and upon answering them correctly, a message will appear on the command line indicating successful logo generation. Locate your logo in the newly created SVG file.

## Contribution
